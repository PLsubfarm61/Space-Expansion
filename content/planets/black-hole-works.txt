how black hole works

it uses

star: black-hole.hjson
planets: black-hole-sunshine.hjson, black-hole-back.hjson

black-hole is a black sphere
black-hole-back is black sphere
black-hole-sunshine is bigger colored sphere

black-hole is a star so its in middle of solar system

black-hole-sunshine is some behind black-hole, its clipping into black-hole,
like black-hole is in black-hole-sunshine but not entire

black-hole-back is behind black-hole-sunshine, but is also in it some

its setup like this
() - black-hole-back
() - black-hole
{} - black-hole-sunshine

({)(})

they are clipping into black-hole-sunshine

how black hole works

it uses

star: black-hole.hjson
planets: black-hole-accretion-disc.hjson, black-hole-back.hjson

black-hole is a black sphere
black-hole-back is black sphere
black-hole-accretion-disc is bigger colored sphere

black-hole is a star so its in middle of solar system

black-hole-accretion-disc is some behind black-hole, its clipping into black-hole,
like black-hole is in black-hole-accretion-disc but not entire

black-hole-back is behind black-hole-accretion-disc, but is also in it some

its setup like this
() - black-hole-back
() - black-hole
{} - black-hole-accretion-disc

({)(})

they are clipping into black-hole-accretion-disc

================

correct:
({)(})

incorrect:
(){}()
